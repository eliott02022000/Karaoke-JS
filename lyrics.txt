[00:21.40]Taught me so many lessons 
[00:22.89]How not to mess with broken hearts, so many questions 
[00:25.40]When this began we was the perfect match, perhaps 
[00:27.65]We had some problems but we workin at it, and now 
[00:30.54]The arguments are gettin' loud, I wanna stay 
[00:32.65]But I can't help from walkin' out just a little way 
[00:35.54]Just take my hand and understand, if you could see 
[00:38.05]I never planned to be a man it just wasn't me 
[00:40.31]But now I'm searchin' for commitment, in other arms 
[00:42.81]I wanna shelter you from harm, don't be alarmed 
[00:45.29]Your attitude was the cause, you got me stressin' 
[00:48.05]Soon as I open up the door with your jealous questions 
[00:50.35]Like where can I be you're killin' me with your jealousy 
[00:53.30]Now my ambition's to be free 
[00:55.31]I can't breathe, cause soon as I leave, it's like a trap 
[00:57.55]I hear you callin' me to come back, I'm a sucka for love 
[01:00.29]What you won't do, do for love 
[01:04.55]You tried everything, but you don't give up 
[01:09.55]What you won't do, do for love 
[01:14.81]You tried everything, but you don't give up 
[01:19.78]Just when I thought I broke away and I'm feelin' happy 
[01:22.05]You try to trap me say you pregnant and guess who the daddy 
[01:24.55]Don't wanna fall for it, but in this case what could I do? So now I'm back 
[01:28.30]To makin promises to you, tryin to keep it true 
[01:30.79]What if I'm wrong, a trick to keep me on and on 
[01:33.29]Tryin' to be strong and in the process, keep you goin 
[01:36.05]I'm bout to lose my composure, I'm gettin' close 
[01:38.54]To packin' up and leavin' notes, and gettin' ghost 
[01:40.79]Tell me who knows, a peaceful place where I can go 
[01:43.54]To clear my head I'm feelin low, losin control 
[01:46.04]My heart is sayin' leave, oh what a tangle web we weave 
[01:49.03]When we conspire to conceive, and now

[02:15.31]You tried everything, but you don't give up 
[02:20.79]Now he left you with scars, tears on your pillow and you still stay 
[02:23.79]As you sit and pray, hoping the beatings'll go away 
[02:26.29]It wasn't always a hit and run relationship 
[02:28.54]It use to be love, happiness and companionship 
[02:31.30]Remember when I treated you good 
[02:33.79]I moved you up to hills, out the ills of the ghetto hood 
[02:36.55]Me and you a happy home, when it was on 
[02:39.04]I had a love to call my own 
[02:40.80]I shoulda seen you was trouble but I was lost, trapped in your eyes 
[02:44.31]Preoccupied with gettin' tossed, no need to lie 
[02:46.54]You had a man and I knew it, you told me 
[02:49.29]Don't worry bout it we can do it now I'm under pressure 
[02:51.79]Make a decision cause I'm waitin', when I'm alone 
[02:54.29]I'm on the phone havin' secret conversations, huh
